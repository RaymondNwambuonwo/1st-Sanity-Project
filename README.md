## Learning Experience
- Headless CMS is easier, faster, and more flexible to develop on.
- It is somehwat future proof given that it separates your front end from your backend data and logic, allowing for easier and cleaner manipulation and creation.
- Makes the project more scalable.
- Easier to learn and use to manage content efficiently and quickly.


## Future Development 
Only has a studio currently, plan to add a front end in the future.
